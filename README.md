# Github Gurus COSC 360 Project
Codeterra: A Coding News Aggregator

# Overview:
A Project by:
Avi Varma & Sam Peter

This project aims to build an online platform that will facilitate developers to create and engage in online discussions about coding and other technology, similar to forums such as [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and Hacker News but with a focus on this specific niche of the internet.  

# CodeTerra Website:
The **CodeTerra** website will allow registered users to engage in online discussions and unregistered users to view discussions similar to forums such as [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and Hacker News.  The goal is to produce a similar type of service that allows users to register, post stories and make comments on items.   Additionally, unregistered users must be able to view the content but will not be able to edit or comment on posts.

# Hardware and Software: 
The project will utilize Linux, MySQL, Apache and PHP on cosc360.ok.ubc.ca, in addition to CSS, HTML5 and JavaScript on the client-side. In addition to the core CSS3, PHP, HTML5 and JavaScript technologies, Bootstrap and JQuery are to be used to help create a visually appealing and interactive web experience. 

The project will be stored in the class provided repository and will deployed to the cosc360 server. The project must be accessible on the UBC network and all source code must be available for review.  You are required to keep your code under version control with GIT.

# Project Statement:
To build a web-based discussion forum that allows users engage in discussion on different posted threads.  Registered users should be able to track the activity of comments on different threads, post comments, create new threads and browse current threads. The system must also support internal use by administrators who can track discussions and moderate discussions, resolve user problems (such as forgotten passwords), and generate usage reports.
