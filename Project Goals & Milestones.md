**Project Objectives:** The objectives are divided into two categories. The first category is the minimal requirements for the project to get a passing grade (C). The other requirements are some of the additional options that can be added to create an improved project. These objectives are further divided based on the implementation of different functional components utilizing different technologies.


# Baseline Objectives:

**Website user’s objectives:**
* Browse discussions without registering
* Search for posts by keyword without registering
* Search for items/posts by keyword without registering
* Register at the site by providing their name, e-mail and image
* Allow user login by providing user id and password
* Create and comment on discussions when logged into the site
* Users are required to be able to view/edit their profile
* User password recovery (via email) 

**Website administrator’s objectives:**
* Search for user by name, email or post
* Enable/disable users
* Edit/remove items and comments
As this project is about demonstrating and applying different web technologies, you will utilize different technologies in the construction of the site.


# Minimum Functional Requirements:
* Hand-styled layout with contextual menus (i.e. when user has logged on to site, menus reflect change). Layout frameworks are not permitted other than Bootstrap (see above).
2 or 3 column layout using appropriate design principles (i.e. highlighting nav links when hovered over, etc) responsive design
* Form validation with JavaScript
* Server-side scripting with PHP
* Data storage in MySQL
* Appropriate security for data
* Site must maintain state (user state being logged on, etc)
* Responsive design philosophy (minimum requirements for different non-mobile display sizes)
* AJAX (or similar) utilization for asynchronous updates (meaning that if a discussion thread is updated, another user who is viewing the same thread will not have to refresh the page to see the update)
* User images (thumbnail) and profile stored in database
* Simple discussion (topics) grouping and display
* Navigation breadcrumb strategy (i.e. user can determine where they are in threads)
* Error handling (bad navigation)


# Additional Requirements:
* Search and analysis for items
* Hot threads/hot item tracking
* Visual display of updates, etc (site usage charts, etc)
* Activity by date
* Tracking (including utilizing tracking API or your own with visualization tools)
* Collapsible items/treads without page reloading
* Alerts on page changes
* Admin view reports on usage (with filtering)
* Styling flourishes
* Responsive layout for mobile
* Tracking comment history from a user’s perspective
* Accessibility
* Your choice (this is your opportunity to add additional flourish’s to your site but will need to be documented in the final report)
